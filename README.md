# AirBnB Clone - RESTful API

## Introduction

This project is an implementation of an AirBnB clone using a RESTful API built with Python and Flask. The aim is to provide a platform for users to list, search, and book accommodations, similar to the functionality provided by AirBnB.

## Project Overview

The project is designed to meet the following objectives:

- Understanding the concepts of REST and APIs
- Implementing a RESTful API using Python and Flask
- Handling HTTP methods for retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting resources
- Implementing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) for secure communication between client and server

## Resources

To understand the concepts and technologies used in this project, it's recommended to go through the following resources:

- [REST API concept page](#) (Provide link if available)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the concepts of REST and APIs without assistance
- Understand CORS and its importance in web development
- Differentiate between various HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs
- Describe the process of requesting resources from a REST API
